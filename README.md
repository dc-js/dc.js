dc.js
=====

Dimensional charting built to work natively with [crossfilter](http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/)
rendered using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). 

**NOTE:** We are seeking new maintainers to join Deepak Kumar. See [#1868](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/issues/1868) for discussion.

In dc.js, each chart displays an aggregation of some
attributes through the position, size, and color of its elements, and also presents a dimension
which can be filtered. When the filter or brush changes, all other charts are updated dynamically,
using animated transitions.

Check out the [example page](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
and its [annotated source](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/stock.html) for a quick five minute
how-to guide. The detailed [API reference is here](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/)
([markdown version](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/blob/master/docs/api-latest.md)). For
more examples and hints please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/wiki).
